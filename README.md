**Development Progress:**
- Core microservices architecture design completed
- User Service: Authentication and profile management implemented
- Chat Service: Conversation and message management implemented  
- AI Service: gRPC integration with Ollama in progress
- API Gateway: WebSocket and service orchestration in development
- Database schemas and migrations established
- Docker containerization and local development environment configured

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a microservices architecture with clear service boundaries and responsibilities, designed for production scalability and maintainability.

**API Gateway** serves as the entry point, handling authentication, rate limiting, and WebSocket connections for real-time communication. It orchestrates requests across downstream services and manages client sessions.

**User Service** manages authentication, user profiles, and preferences using JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing. It provides user analytics and activity tracking with proper security measures including account lockout policies.

**Chat Service** handles conversation sessions and message persistence. It maintains chat history, manages typing indicators, and provides search capabilities across conversations with full-text indexing.

**AI Service** integrates with Ollama for AI response generation, supporting multiple models and streaming responses. It processes conversation context and generates intelligent replies with configurable parameters like temperature and token limits.

## Technology Stack

**Backend Services (In Development):**
- API Gateway: Node.js with TypeScript, Express, Socket.IO for WebSocket support
- User Service: Go with gRPC, GORM for database operations, Redis for caching
- Chat Service: Go with gRPC, PostgreSQL for message storage, Redis for session management  
- AI Service: Python with FastAPI, gRPC server, Ollama integration for AI generation

**Data Layer:**
- PostgreSQL for persistent data storage (users, conversations, messages)
- Redis for caching, session management, and real-time features
- Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities and log aggregation (planned)

**Communication Protocols:**
- gRPC for internal service communication with Protocol Buffers
- WebSocket for real-time client communication  
- REST APIs for external integrations and debugging

**Infrastructure & DevOps:**
- Docker for containerization with multi-stage builds
- Docker Compose for local development environment
- Kubernetes-ready architecture with health checks and monitoring endpoints
- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring (planned)

## Planned Features

**Real-time Communication:**
WebSocket-based instant message delivery with typing indicators, streaming AI responses, and seamless real-time interactions without polling overhead.

**Advanced AI Integration:**
Multiple AI model support through Ollama, with configurable personas (assistant, creative, analytical, professional). Streaming responses for better user experience and conversation context maintenance across multiple turns.

**Production-Ready Architecture:**
Comprehensive health checks, structured logging, graceful shutdown handling, and robust error management. Rate limiting, request validation, and security best practices throughout.

**Scalability & Performance:**
Independent service scaling, connection pooling, intelligent caching strategies, and asynchronous processing. Horizontal scaling support and load balancing across service instances.

**Security & Compliance:**
JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, bcrypt password hashing, comprehensive input validation, CORS policies, and multi-layer rate limiting protection.

## Development Approach

**Microservices Design Principles:**
Each service maintains clear boundaries with single responsibilities, communicates through well-defined APIs, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

**Production Engineering Focus:**
The development process emphasizes production-readiness from the start, including proper error handling, monitoring capabilities, security considerations, and performance optimization.

**Modern Development Practices:**
Implementation follows current industry standards with comprehensive testing strategies, code quality tools, API documentation, database migrations, and CI/CD pipeline preparation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with clear separation between services and shared components:

- **services/api-gateway**: Node.js/TypeScript gateway service handling routing and WebSocket management
- **services/user-service**: Go-based user management with authentication and profiles
- **services/chat-service**: Go-based conversation management with message persistence
- **services/ai-service**: Python-based AI integration with Ollama and gRPC streaming
- **proto**: Shared protobuf definitions for service communication contracts
- **infrastructure**: Docker configurations and deployment specifications
- **scripts**: Development automation and deployment utilities

## Technical Implementation Highlights

**gRPC Communication Layer:**
All internal services communicate via gRPC for high performance, strong typing with Protocol Buffers, and built-in features like connection pooling, load balancing, and health checking.

**Real-time Streaming Architecture:**
The system implements a sophisticated streaming pipeline where AI responses flow from the AI service through gRPC streams to the API Gateway, which then broadcasts them to clients via WebSocket connections.

**Data Modeling:**
Comprehensive data models designed for scalability, with proper relationships, indexing strategies, and caching layers to support high-throughput conversational workloads.

**Security Implementation:**
Multi-layered security approach including JWT tokens with refresh mechanics, password policy enforcement, rate limiting at multiple levels, and input validation throughout the request pipeline.

## Monitoring and Observability (Planned)

**Health Monitoring:**
Each service exposes detailed health endpoints for Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes, with the API Gateway providing aggregated health status across all services.

**Structured Logging:**
Comprehensive logging with correlation IDs for request tracing across service boundaries, including user context, performance metrics, and detailed error information for debugging.

**Metrics and Alerting:**
Services will expose Prometheus metrics including request rates, response times, error rates, and business metrics like active conversations and AI generation latency.

## Future Enhancements

The project roadmap includes advanced features that will be implemented in subsequent development phases:

- Frontend application with React/Next.js
- Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities with vector databases
- Event-driven architecture with RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
- Elasticsearch integration for advanced search and analytics
- Comprehensive monitoring with Grafana dashboards and alerting
- Kubernetes deployment configurations for production scaling
- CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployment

## Development Philosophy

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern software engineering practices, emphasizing clean architecture, proper testing methodologies, production readiness, and scalable design patterns. The development process prioritizes code quality, maintainability, and real-world applicability.

The implementation showcases expertise in distributed systems, microservices architecture, real-time communication, AI integration, and DevOps practices, making it a valuable reference for production-grade software development.

## Current Focus
